This project will create a 2 dimensional LED board that can track and display patterns of hand motions
over the board within a certain proximity.

Schedule

• November 18: Mini project update: Demonstrate sensor action
• November 25: Measure sensor accuracy and calibrate appropriately
• December 2: Continue debugging. If no bugs, add features
• December 9: System testing, measure false positives, assess sensitivity and calibrate for different test
environments
If time, add additional features (ideas in mind: pattern recognition, image file display, etc.)
